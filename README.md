# Title - LocalNotify
LocalNotify is a web application designed to address the communication needs of a local community or neighborhood. It combines the functionality of a Smart Mirror with a hyperlocal announcement platform, while utilizing JWT (JSON Web Token) token-based authentication for secure access control.

The application allows residents to log in using their credentials and receive a unique JWT token, ensuring secure and authenticated access to the platform. Once logged in, users can access and manage hyperlocal announcements relevant to their community.

LocalNotify incorporates an additional CRUD feature, the Announcement Manager. This feature enables authorized users to create, read, update, and delete announcements for the local community. Users can post announcements about upcoming events, community initiatives, neighborhood meetings, important alerts, and other relevant information. The Announcement Manager provides a convenient interface for users to publish and manage announcements in a centralized platform.

With LocalNotify, residents can stay informed about the latest happenings in their neighborhood. They can view announcements tailored to their community, ensuring they receive relevant information in a timely manner. The intuitive user interface, inspired by the Smart Mirror concept, enhances the user experience and facilitates easy navigation through the announcement feed.

LocalNotify also includes robust user profile management and role-based access control. Administrators have the ability to manage user profiles, control access permissions, and moderate the announcements to ensure the platform remains a trusted source of information for the local community.

By leveraging the power of hyperlocal announcements and secure access control, LocalNotify enhances community engagement and facilitates effective communication within the neighborhood. It serves as a reliable platform for residents to share and receive important updates, fostering a sense of belonging and connectedness among community members.
